# AI-ML-Mini-Projects
This repository contains source code for mini projects based on basic concepts, algorithms and models of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

The code is written in Python3.x and the files are present in the form of .ipynb notebooks which can be opened using Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab 
or any other IDE that supports the same. If you are running the files locally using Jupyter Notebook or any other IDE, make sure to install the requried packages and modules using "pip".
